# DynamoNodeModelsEssentials

This project provides Visual Studio templates for advanced Dynamo package development using Node Models.

## Acknowledgments

The templates and samples provided in this project are inspired by [github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples](https://github.com/DynamoDS/DynamoSamples) and [github.com/teocomi/HelloDynamo](https://github.com/teocomi/HelloDynamo) — two resources that I highly recommend you take a look at for further learning.
